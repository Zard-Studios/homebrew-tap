      Finish setup with:
        winecord setup

      Remove WineCord's LaunchAgent and Wine-side helper before uninstalling:
        winecord uninstall
        brew uninstall winecord

      If a configured Wine prefix is on an external volume, connect it before running winecord uninstall.

      If your Wine prefix is not auto-detected:
        winecord setup --prefix /path/to/prefix

      If that prefix needs a specific Wine runner:
        winecord setup --prefix /path/to/prefix --wine /path/to/wine

    assert_match "WineCord", shell_output("#{bin}/winecord --version")
